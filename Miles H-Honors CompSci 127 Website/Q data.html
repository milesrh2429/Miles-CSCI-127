<h1>Q Station Zip Code Data</h1>

<h2> Neighborhood Research</h2>
<p> As part of my study of the neighborhoods surrounding the Q train stations, I recorded the walkability score, median household income, and median age for each station's neighborhood based on zip code.</p>

<p> Walkability scores reflect how walkable a zip code is, with 100 being a perfect walkability score. This data is informed by factors such as ease of commute, local proximity to public transit and other crucial destinations, the degree of car-dependency, how hazardous or hilly the area is, the quality of local public infastrcutre, etc. For the walkability scores, I referenced

<p> Median household income reflects how wealthy the residents of a zip code are, which can affect factors such as funding towards the quality of a neighborhood and its amenities/infastructure, neighborhood desirability, crime rates, local pollution, etc. Median age may relate to median household income to an extent (usually, older people have more wealth), but it may also relate to neighborhood desirability/rated quality, demand for certain local infastructure/services/amentities, resident turnover, etc. For the median household income and median age, I referenced

<h2> Neighborhood Rank</h2>
<p> I also found the ranking of every neighborhood in a niche called "Best ZIP Codes to Live in New York City Area" (#1 is ranked the best neighborhood). The reasoning around this niche is expanded here:

<h2> Data Analysis </h2>
<p> 
Overall, it appears that neighborhoods with better walkability and higher median household income tended to correlate with higher niche ranks. This result was not a surprise, as walkability is a significant consideration when determining if an area is a good place to live. For instance, it affects whether someone may need to own a car, how easily they could get to important destinations (like stores, work, and school), how community-based and/or urban the neighborhood feels, etc. Furthermore, it was expected that higher median household income would correlate with higher rankings, as wealthier residents are more capable of contributing funds towards public infastructure, parks, quality amenities/services, and other factors that increase the quality and desirability of a neighborhood. Wealthier areas are also more insulated against (violent) crime, further increasing their desirability. Moreover, not only is it conceivable that higher incomes could lead to improvements in a neighborhood's quality, but also, residents of a higher quality neighborhood likely have better chances of acquiring more wealth due to better social/community support (like better schools), perpetuating the cycle of neighborhood wealth/status.

<br>
Higher median household income seemed to correlate with better walkability. This could be because wealthy residents of a neighborhood are more capable of funding public infastructure, parks, etc., thereby improving walkability. 
<br>
<br>
Median age did not seem to correlate to niche score, however young outliers seemed to relate to high-rated areas whereas older outliers related to low-rated areas. To theorize, these outliers may be the result of lower mobility in old age due to limited retirement funds, fixed incomes, or emotional attachments to neighborhoods lived in long-term despite their downsides/decline. Inversely, young people display more mobility and may move to better areas for opportunity, the chance of higher wages, etc.
