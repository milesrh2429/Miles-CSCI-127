<h1>"Best ZIP Codes to Live in New York City Area"</h1>

<h3>Chosen Niche Explained</h3>

<p>
    In my research, I used the niche “Best ZIP Codes to Live in New York City Area” to narrow the rankings down to just the NYC area rather than the country or the whole state. This makes the scores more relevant to New York City residents in particular. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Furthermore, I picked the ‘best place to live’ category over the ‘most diverse,’ ‘best public schools,’ or ‘best for families’ categories because I believed it would be the most general, yet relevant point of comparison to the other data points, as walkability, age demographics, and household income may impact a neighborhood's quality and/or desirability. Inversely, a neighborhood's quality/desirability may impact the age and income brackets that are attracted to and/or able to afford to live in said area. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally, I used the zip code specific list because using zip code as a means to specify location for all data points will allow for the most accurate comparisons between variables while minimizing confusion.
