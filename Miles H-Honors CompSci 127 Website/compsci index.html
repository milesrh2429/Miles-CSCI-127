<h1>Honors CompSci 127: NYC Neighborhood Analysis</h1>
<p> by Miles Harrington </p>
<p> Fall Semester of 2025</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p> 
For this assignment, students were tasked with picking a train station in New York City, identifying the neighborhoods (by zip code) of each of the train route's stations, and collecting data about those neighborhoods to analyze potential trends and correlations. 
<br>
<br>
For my project, I picked the Q train. Then, I collected neighborhood data such as walkability, median household income, and median age. Moreover, I found how niche.com ranked each of my neighborhoods according to the niche "Best ZIP Codes to Live in New York City Area." 
<br>
<br>
After collecting all this data into a table, I made plots to visualize the relationship between different variables and analyzed these results for trends/correlations. Overall, I found that neighborhoods with better walkability and higher median household income tended to correlate with higher niche ranks, likely due to these areas being more well-funded and transversable. Furthermore, higher median household income seemed to correlate with better walkability, which could be because these neighborhoods are more capable of funding public infastructure. Median age did not seem to correlate to niche score, however young outliers seemed to relate to high-rated areas whereas older outliers related to low-rated areas. To theorize, these outliers may be the result of lower mobility in old age due to limited retirement funds, fixed incomes, or emotional attachments to neighborhoods lived in long-term despite their downsides/decline. Inversely, young people display more mobility and may move to better areas for opportunity, the chance of higher wages, etc.
